# Text Editor

## Description

I have built a text editor that runs in the browser. This will allow you to create notes or code with any internet connection.
Which allows fo retrieval later for when you have those moments with no service. This is also a single page application so everything
should be handled on the one page.

## Installation

Clone the repo
npm install
npm run start

## Usage

After running npm run start you should be able to open it on your local host port 3000 with insomnia.
